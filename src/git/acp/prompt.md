# Git-ACP Script Specification

## Overview

You are an expert bash script developer tasked with creating a comprehensive Git workflow automation script named 'git-acp'. This script should incorporate advanced features, best practices, and integrations for modern software development workflows.

## Core Functionality

### Basic Git Operations

1. Combine git add, commit, and push operations into a single command.
2. Use "Auto Commit" as the default commit message, allowing users to override it.
3. Include a confirmation prompt before pushing changes.
4. Add an option to show the diff before committing.
5. Include an option to create a new branch before committing.
6. Include a feature to squash multiple commits before pushing.
7. Add support for interactive rebase before pushing.
8. Support both HTTPS and SSH protocols for Git operations.
9. Provide an option to set default branch names for new branches.
10. Include an option to automatically create and push Git tags.

### User Interface and Experience

1. Use color-coded output for better readability.
2. Include a help message explaining how to use the script.
3. Add a verbose mode that shows more detailed information about each step.
4. Add a dry-run mode that shows what actions would be taken without actually performing them.
5. Include recommended aliases or shortcuts for commonly used options in the script.

### Error Handling and Logging

1. Check if the current directory is a Git repository before proceeding.
2. Include error handling and informative output throughout the script.
3. Add a flag to abort the operation at any point.
4. Include a log file for tracking script usage, stored in the same directory as the script. Auto-create if it doesn't exist.
5. Implement robust error handling for network issues during push operations.
6. Set the number of retry attempts for network issues as a constant that users can easily modify.

### Configuration and Customization

1. Add support for customizing the script's behavior through a configuration file.
2. Include Git configuration checks for user.name and user.email, prompting the user to set them if they're missing.
3. Add support for multiple Git identities (e.g., work and personal).
4. Ensure compatibility with both Bash and Zsh shells.

## Advanced Features

### Integration and APIs

1. Add a feature to integrate with popular Git hosting platforms' APIs (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2. Provide an option to integrate with continuous integration (CI) systems.
3. Provide an option to integrate with project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello).
4. Provide an option to integrate with containerization tools (e.g., Docker).
5. Provide an option to integrate with cloud storage services for backup purposes.
6. Provide an option to integrate with time tracking or project estimation tools.

### Code Quality and Security

1. Implement security checks and warnings for sensitive files, large files, personal information, GPG signing, submodules, and protected branches.
2. Add support for automatic code formatting before committing.
3. Include an option for running pre-defined test suites before pushing.
4. Add a feature for automated code review suggestions using AI.
5. Add support for automatic code quality checks (e.g., linting, static analysis).
6. Add a feature for automated security vulnerability scanning of dependencies.
7. Add support for automatic license compliance checking.

### Performance and Optimization

1. Implement performance optimizations for large repositories.
2. Include an option for running performance benchmarks before and after changes.
3. Implement features for managing large binary files in Git repositories, including:
    - Integration with Git Large File Storage (LFS)
    - Option to automatically detect and suggest LFS tracking for large files
    - Support for chunked file transfers to improve performance with large files
    - Ability to configure size thresholds for LFS tracking
    - Option to exclude specific file types or paths from LFS tracking
    - Integration with cloud object storage services for LFS backend (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)

### Documentation and Visualization

1. Include an option to generate a simple changelog based on commit messages, with customizable format.
2. Add support for automatic documentation generation based on code changes.
3. Include an option for generating visual Git history graphs.
4. Include an option for generating project dependency graphs.

### Automation and Workflow

1. Add support for Git hooks integration (generic, for user customization).
2. Include an option to automatically fetch and merge changes before pushing, with the ability to opt-out.
3. Add a feature to automatically update the script to the latest version from a remote repository.
4. Add support for automatic dependency updates in projects.
5. Include an option for generating code coverage reports before pushing.
6. Add a feature to generate release notes based on conventional commit messages.
7. Add a feature for automated merge conflict resolution suggestions.
8. Add a feature for automated release management and changelog generation.

## Implementation Guidelines

- The script should be highly modular, allowing users to easily enable or disable features as needed.
- Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the script.
- Always assume there are changes to commit without checking.
